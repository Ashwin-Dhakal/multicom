tm_hhsuite_main_v2.pl: test: standard test based on regular alignments: work slightly better on T0950  (default one. to be used)

tm_hhsuite_main_global.pl: test_global: based on global alignments (to be used)


The overlap between the standard models and global models needs to be removed. 

test_local: based on local alignments: does not work well T0950 (not used). 1K4P's alignment is too short.
